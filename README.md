Welcome to the Stats-Modeling wiki!

The Dataset is about Telecommunication, call durations and the international plans.

Data preprocessing is done to know the details , checking and handling the missing values, where type conversion for required columns are performed.

The data is then split into train and validation sets based on the column 'trainrows' with 'yes' belong to train data and 'no' to validation data.

Model is then build for all attributes and the performance is analyzed, interpret coefficients for any of the numerical and categorical attributes.

The model is then improved building additional models by applying VIF and ROC curve, the new model is imposed with regularization and the performance is analyzed again.
